# HandSpeak
Many people in Indonesia use sign language to communicate, but not everyone understands sign language so they often experience barriers to interaction, which can lead to isolation, limited opportunities, and disconnection from the wider community. HandSpeak is a project that aims to address the communication gap between sign language and non-sign language users. HandSpeak uses computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning technologies to translate sign language into written text, increasing accessibility and awareness of communication needs. 

HandSpeak believes that all people deserve equal access to information and communication. The project seeks to answer questions such as how to develop efficient sign language translation systems, what impact these technologies have on individuals with hearing loss, and how to promote sign language learning and understanding among non-sign language users. The project has a mission to create user-friendly and inclusive solutions to make communication accessible to everyone. With a social responsibility goal of creating inclusivity and a fairer world, HandSpeak is committed to creating solutions that remove communication barriers and create a more connected and accessible future.
